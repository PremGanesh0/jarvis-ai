Overview
J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fully offline, privacy-first AI personal assistant for Android, inspired by Iron Man's AI companion.

🎯 Core Vision: Self-Improving AI
JARVIS learns from every conversation and gets smarter every day:
- Day 1: Makes mistakes, learns your basics (~60% accuracy)
- Week 1: Understands patterns, fewer errors (~70% accuracy)
- Month 1: Anticipates needs, rarely wrong (~80% accuracy)
- Month 6: Knows you deeply, highly accurate (~95% accuracy)
- Year 1+: Like a lifelong companion (~98% accuracy)

Key Principle: Every correction makes JARVIS smarter. Every conversation adds knowledge. Accuracy grows continuously without app updates.
